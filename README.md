Easy Loan

The Loan Application is a mobile-based solution developed using Flutter that aims to streamline the process of applying for various types of loans. It provides a clean and user-friendly interface for customers to submit loan requests and enables administrators to manage and process those requests efficiently.
The application is divided into two main modules â€“ User Module and Admin Module.

#User Module:
In the user section, individuals can sign up or log in securely to their accounts. After authentication, they can choose from different loan types such as Personal Loan, Home Loan, or Vehicle Loan. 

#Admin Module:
The admin section is built to manage and monitor all user-submitted applications. Admins have access to a dashboard where they can:
View all loan applications
Check and verify the uploaded documents
Approve or reject applications based on eligibility
Update or manage user details if needed
